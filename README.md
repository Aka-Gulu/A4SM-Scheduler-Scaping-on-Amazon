# A4SM-Scheduler-Scaping-on-Amazon

## Introduction
This project focuses on scraping sales data for five different brands of gaming laptops from Amazon during the Thanksgiving holidays and normal non-festival days. The objective is to analyze price points and consumer ratings for these products over seven consecutive days, capturing a total of 175 data points.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To scrape and analyze price and consumer rating data for five different gaming laptop brands over a period of seven days.
- To compare the pricing and rating trends during the holiday season with those during regular days.
- To provide insights on how price fluctuations and consumer ratings impact sales and customer satisfaction.

## Methodology
1. **Web Scraping:** 
   - Used Python and libraries such as `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and `Schedule` to scrape data from Amazon.
   - Collected product name, price, and consumer rating.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Organized data into a structured format for analysis.
   - Ensured data quality by handling missing values and inconsistencies.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Compared price trends and consumer ratings across the two time slots.
   - Identified patterns and significant fluctuations in pricing.

## Key Findings
- **Price Reduction During Holidays:** A clear pattern of price reduction was observed during the Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday period followed by a return to normal pricing.
- **Consumer Ratings:** Consistent consumer ratings across different time periods suggest a stable quality perception among consumers.
- **Price Fluctuations:** Some products exhibited significant price fluctuations, indicating strategic discounting or inventory clearance by retailers.
